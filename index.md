Hello 👋🏼

Want to know what we're building? Our main platform is called CVaaS - Connected Vehicle as a Service. It's made up of hardware + software that is built into a vehicle, a cloud platform on AWS, and some mobile apps. We supply the complete, end-to-end platform so we can optimse the performance and security of the whole system rather than being locked into an API that we can't change. If you want to understand more about our platform, check out our main website **[here](https://beamconnectivity.com)**. 

This site is all about our Beam Team developers - our high performance, cross-functional team of embedded, cloud and mobile engineers.

## We ❤ modern tech

We use the right tool for the job but try to converge around a few, solid but flexible technologies.

🚗 **Embedded**: Linux, C, bash, python, SQLite

⛅ **Cloud**: MQTT, AWS serverless, python, Javascript, Presto DB, Apache Spark, CloudFlare

📱 **Mobile**: Swift, Kotlin, Fastlane, Firebase

🧰 **DevOps**: Docker, Azure DevOps, bash, python

Our CI-CD infrastructure is highly automated and runs on Azure DevOps. We are rightfully proud of how smoothly and consistently we can deliver quality software. Our delivery process gives us clear traceability from tickets, through code, tests and PRs, and out to automated release pipelines.

We also do a lot of hardware engineering, both prototyping with Raspberry Pis and developing our own, bespoke, automotive-grade electronics.
