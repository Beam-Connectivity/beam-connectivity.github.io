### About Beam Connectivity

Pioneers in better Connected Vehicles: Beam Connectivity is a startup in the mobility space. We work with established and up-and-coming vehicle manufacturers to deliver best-in-class connected vehicle experiences in cars, buses, e-scooters and e-bikes.

Founded in January 2020, we have built a superb engineering team and deployed our connected vehicle platform to several customers. To support the next phase of our growth we are now hiring an Account Manager in our new commercial team. 

#### Improving the world of connected vehicles

The experience that users get with today's connected vehicle solutions is poor - painfully slow, clunky and often insecure. We believe that part of the reason for this is the way those solutions are delivered - outsourced to numerous companies, none of which have a deep understanding, nor the responsibility for the end-to-end system. 

Delivering a robust connected solution requires a wide variety of skills. At Beam, we are a truly multi-disciplinary team, covering all the skills required to deliver a first class connected experience. Our flagship product is the Connected Vehicle as a Service platform, or CVaaS. This platform includes: 1) Electronics hardware deployed in a vehicle, 2) Embedded software, 3) Cloud services, 4) Mobile apps. 

#### Building a world class commercial team

We have launched the Connected Vehicle as a Service (CVaaS) platform and deployed it to several lead customers. As Account Manager you be the interface between our product development team and our customers. You should have a deep interest in discussing highly technical concepts while building strong relationships with customers.

In taking one of the first commercial roles at Beam Connectivity, you will play a key role in steering how we approach technology deployment with customers. You will contribute to building a commercial team, working alongside our fantastic engineers who are receiving accolades from customers.
