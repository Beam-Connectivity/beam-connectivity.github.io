### About Beam Connectivity

Beam Connectivity are a startup in the automotive IoT space. We work with established and up-and-coming vehicle manufacturers to deliver best-in-class connected vehicle experiences. After a successful first 5 years and [announcement of strategic funding](https://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/wae-announces-a-strategic-equity-investment-in-beam-connectivity-limited-supporting-the-commercialisation-of-connected-vehicle-systems/) from Fortescue, we have now secured new projects and are expanding our software team. 

#### Improving the world of connected vehicles

The experience that users get with today's connected vehicle solutions is pretty poor - painfully slow, clunky and often insecure. We believe that part of the reason for this is the way those solutions are delivered - outsourced to numerous companies, none of which have a deep understanding, nor the responsibility for the end-to-end system. 

Delivering a robust automotive IoT solution requires a wide variety of skills and experience. At Beam, we are a truly multi-disciplinary team, covering all the skills required to deliver a first class connected experience. Our flagship product is the _Connected Vehicle as a Service platform_, or CVaaS. This platform includes: 1) Electronics hardware deployed in a vehicle, 2) Embedded software, 3) Cloud services, 4) Mobile apps. We do all this under one roof, so you'll be exposed to all this technology at one time or other. This should excite you, not scare you... 

At Beam, we spend our engineering energy on three main things: 
* Building the [Elysia platform](https://elysia.co/) with our investor, Fortescue.
* Building out our core CVaaS platform - Building new features, adding resilience, and rolling this out to vehicle manufacturers.
* Research projects to help our long term CVaaS platform roadmap - Examples: [SecureTCU](https://securetcu.io), satellite comms PoC, video streaming (car-to-mobile) and novel data compression.

#### Thoughtful technology choices

We use modern software delivery practices to build clean, resilient software. At Beam we are building a single platform, not delivering a series of separate projects. As we are a small team we need to make sustainable technology choices for the long term, understanding and articulating the risks and trade-offs of our design decisions within the team. 

### The Role

As a Fullstack Software Engineer you will be focused on building out one of our cloud platforms, which runs on AWS. We want someone who can develop professional looking web apps, but can also delve into the backend code where required. You should primarily be a strong Frontend Developer, but be able to handle yourself when navigating and contributing to the backend. You will be working with cutting-edge technology and we can guarantee the work will be challenging, exciting and satisfying.

We are looking for someone who takes pride in writing software; someone who sees code as craft. Strong collaboration between disciplines is a feature of our agile practice, so being able to articulate technical detail at the right level for the audience is important. 

#### Main responsibilities

1. Develop web apps to manage the platform and provide data analysis features ‚Äì lots of tables, charts, graphs.
1. Design web UI/UX, sometimes independently and sometimes with external design team input. We use Figma for wireframes and UX design.
1. Develop web APIs for internal and third party integrations.
1. Integrate software and tests into our CI-CD system
1. Work as part of the team, reviewing each others' designs and code.

#### Core skills

These are the primary skills that the job entails.

1. Strong web app development skills in React‚öõÔ∏è, or another modern framework.
1. Strong in Typescript and Javascript (or keen to improve ü§ì).
1. Test frameworks to support unit, integration and UI tests (where appropriate)
1. REST API design - publishing and consuming
1. Investigative and innovative - able to solve problems, make technical leaps and find solutions.
1. Intelligently embrace AI coding tools - able to balance rapid code generation and long term maintenance of a system

#### Nice to have skills

These are disciplines that we are already strong in because they're part of our core stack. Any experience you have with these would be a bonus, but is by no means a requirement.

1. Relational database design and CRUD
1. Building and running Docker containers
1. Deploying to AWS serverless stack (Lambda/ECS)
1. Python application development
1. Experience with NoSQL data persistence - DynamoDB, MongoDB, etc.
1. DevOps mindset - knowing how to automate development and operational tasks
1. Big data or data science background: ML, Apache Spark, Apache Hive, machine learning
