### About Beam Connectivity

Beam Connectivity are a startup in the automotive IoT space. We work with established and up-and-coming vehicle manufacturers to deliver best-in-class connected vehicle experiences. After a successful first 3 years and [announcement of strategic funding](https://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/wae-announces-a-strategic-equity-investment-in-beam-connectivity-limited-supporting-the-commercialisation-of-connected-vehicle-systems/) from WAE Technologies, we have now secured new projects and are expanding our software team. 

Join us at Beam - as an early team member you will play a key role in our growth, while we take a key role in yours.

#### Improving the world of connected vehicles

The experience that users get with today's connected vehicle solutions is pretty poor - painfully slow, clunky and often insecure. We believe that part of the reason for this is the way those solutions are delivered - outsourced to numerous companies, none of which have a deep understanding, nor the responsibility for the end-to-end system. 

Delivering a robust automotive IoT solution requires a wide variety of skills and experience. At Beam, we are a truly multi-disciplinary team, covering all the skills required to deliver a first class connected experience. Our flagship product is the Connected Vehicle as a Service platform, or CVaaS. This platform includes: 1) Electronics hardware deployed in a vehicle, 2) Embedded software, 3) Cloud services, 4) Mobile apps. We do all this under one roof, so you'll be exposed to all this technology at one time or other. This should excite you, not scare you!

At Beam, we spend our engineering energy on three main things: 
* Building out our core CVaaS platform - Building new features, adding resilience, and rolling this out to OEM customers.
* Research projects to help our long term platform roadmap - Examples: [AutoCHERI](https://autocheri.tech), satellite comms PoC, video streaming and compression PoC.
* Building the [Elysia platform](https://elysia.co/) with our investor, WAE Technologies.

#### Thoughtful technology choices

We use modern software delivery practices to build clean, resilient software. As we are a small team we need to make sustainable technology choices for the long term, understanding and articulating the risks and trade-offs of our design decisions within the team. 

### The Role

As an embedded software engineer you will be focused on building our TCU (Telematics Control Unit) embedded software, which runs on our hardware in clients' vehicles. We have three active hardware platforms for different scenarios: 1) prototyping with Raspberry Pis, 2) our bespoke, automotive-grade electronics for cars, lorries and buses, and 3) our bespoke micromobility (ebike/scooter). You would be expected to work across both and so be comfortable writing software to target any of them. 

We are looking for someone who takes pride in writing elegant software; someone who sees code as craft. Strong collaboration between disciplines is a feature of our agile practice, so being able to articulate technical detail at the right level for the audience is important. As you would be working with cutting-edge technology and we can guarantee the work will be challenging, exciting and satisfying.

We have strong processes in place for the design and delivery of software, so are looking for someone who can fit in with our engineering culture. During your time at Beam you will be working both on our core CVaaS product and also our cutting edge PoCs.

#### Main responsibilities

While the team are always on hand to support, your main responsibilities day-to-day would revolve around these:

1. Design, implementation and test of software to run on our hardware.
1. Integration of software and tests into our CI system.
1. Software prototyping on new hardware platforms.
1. Working with the hardware team on board bring-up - managing firmware and debug software.
1. Preparing demos for trade-shows and customer presentations

#### Core skills

These are the primary skills that the job entails.

1. C programming and unit testing.
1. Solid python skills - writing and testing clean code.
1. Shell scripting to support devops processes.
1. Embedded Linux - kernel build, device trees, debugging.
1. Serial Protocols ‚Äì SPI, I<sup>2</sup>C, UART.
1. Investigative and innovative - able to solve problems, make technical leaps and find solutions.
1. Being a nice person - we are a distributed team, so building and maintaining relationships within the team is key!

#### Nice to have skills

These are disciplines that we are already strong in because they're part of our core stack. Any experience you have with these would be a bonus, but is by no means a requirement.

1. Networking and/or wireless comms - cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, satellite.
1. CAN devices or other bus protocols.
1. Hardware prototyping experience with commodity components - e.g. Raspberry Pi, Arduino.
1. DevOps mindset - knowing how and when to automate development and operational tasks.
