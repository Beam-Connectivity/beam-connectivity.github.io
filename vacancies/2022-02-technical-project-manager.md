### About Beam Connectivity

Beam Connectivity are a startup in the automotive IoT space. We work with established and up-and-coming vehicle manufacturers to deliver best-in-class connected vehicle experiences. After a successful first two years we have now secured new projects and are expanding our project delivery team. Join us at Beam - as an early team member you will play a key role in our growth, while we take a key role in yours.

#### Improving the world of connected vehicles

The experience that users get with today's connected vehicle solutions is pretty poor - painfully slow, clunky and often insecure. We believe that part of the reason for this is the way those solutions are delivered - outsourced to numerous companies, none of which have a deep understanding, nor the responsibility for of the end-to-end system. 

Delivering a robust IoT solution requires a wide variety of skills and experience. At Beam, we are a truly multi-disciplinary team, covering all the skills required to deliver a first class connected experience. Our flagship product is the Connected Vehicle as a Service platform, or CVaaS. This platform includes: 1) Electronics hardware deployed in a vehicle, 2) Embedded software, 3) Cloud services, 4) Mobile apps. We do all this under one roof, so you'll be exposed to all this technology at one time or other. This should excite you, not scare you!

#### Taking pride in delivery excellence

We strive to exceed customer expectations in delivering our CVaaS platform and other technology innovation projects. We deliver our projects with close stakeholder engagement, practical and rapid decisions, and a light touch of good process. We are a tightly-knight team where each member has an impact and contributes towards our ambitions to be the best in our industry sector in terms of our CVaaS performance and for delivery excellence.

### The Role

As Project Manager you will work at the interface between our customers and our development team, taking the lead role in delivering CVaaS and other cutting-edge technology projects. 

We are looking for someone who understands "traditional" project management methodologies, as well as modern software delivery (Agile) and will apply these to multi-functional development projects combining electronics, embedded, cloud and mobile software, and cyber security. You should be interested in our technology focus areas, and in striving for excellence in project delivery.

We can guarantee the work will be challenging, exciting and satisfying.

#### Main responsibilities

1. Take the role of lead project manager for 2-3 projects. These will range from agile software delivery requiring a daily touchpoint, through to multi-year, multi-partner innovation projects requiring monthly reporting and meetings on behalf of a project consortium including commercial partners and universities
2. Interface between customers, internal development teams, our senior team and other stakeholders guiding projects through their entire lifecycle, from setup, through delivery and completion
3. Monitor and report on project delivery schedules, costs, emerging challenges and opportunities
4. Propose and implement project management processes which improve our delivery
5. Understand our product range in depth
6. Maintain and deploy tools for project management 

#### Core skills

These are the primary skills that the job entails. 

1. Traditional project management techniques. Monitoring and reporting time, costs, quality.
2. Agile project delivery management techniques. Working with our software development team and our customers to 
3. Deep understanding in our areas of technology and innovation
4. Desire to exceed expectations in project delivery
5. Motivated and able to work autonomously

We realize managing this range of project styles may be unusual and favour potential and ambition over specific experience in a particular delivery methodology. This position will suit a highly-motivated candidate at the start or early in their project management career, with an engineering background or having recently transitioned from a development team.

#### Nice to have skills

Any experience you have with these would be a bonus, but is by no means a requirement.

1. Use of formal project management tools e.g. Microsoft Project
2. Worked with teams using kanban or sprint based software delivery
3. Task based project deliver tools e.g. Azure DevOps, Jira or equivalent
4. Project Management qualification e.g. PRINCE2, PMP etc
