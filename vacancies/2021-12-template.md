## About Beam Connectivity

Beam Connectivity are a startup in the automotive IoT space. We work with established and up-and-coming vehicle manufacturers to deliver best-in-class connected vehicle experiences. After a successful first 18 months we have now secured new projects and are expanding our software team. Join us at Beam - as an early team member you will play a key role in our growth, while we take a key role in yours.

### Improving the world of connected vehicles

The experience that users get with today's connected vehicle solutions is pretty poor - painfully slow, clunky and often insecure. We believe that part of the reason for this is the way those solutions are delivered - outsourced to numerous companies, none of which have a deep understanding, nor the responsibility for of the end-to-end system. 

Delivering a robust IoT solution requires a wide variety of skills and experience. At Beam, we are a truly multi-disciplinary team, covering all the skills required to deliver a first class connected experience. Our flagship product is the Connected Vehicle as a Service platform, or CVaaS. This platform includes: 1) Electronics hardware deployed in a vehicle, 2) Embedded software, 3) Cloud services, 4) Mobile apps. We do all this under one roof, so you'll be exposed to all this technology at one time or other. This should excite you, not scare you!

### Thoughtful technology choices

We use modern software delivery practices to build clean, resilient software. At Beam we are building a single platform, not delivering a series of separate projects. As we are a small team we need to make sustainable technology choices for the long term, understanding and articulating the risks and trade-offs of our design decisions within the team.
