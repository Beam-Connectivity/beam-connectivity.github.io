### About Beam Connectivity

Pioneers in better Connected Vehicles: Beam Connectivity are a startup in the connected vehicle space. We work with established and up-and-coming vehicle manufacturers to deliver best-in-class connected vehicle experiences.

Founded in January 2020, we have built a superb engineering team and deployed our connected vehicle platform to several customers. Strengthened by a recent [strategic investment from WAE](https://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/wae-announces-a-strategic-equity-investment-in-beam-connectivity-limited-supporting-the-commercialisation-of-connected-vehicle-systems/), we are now seeking a Sales Director to support the next phase of our growth.

Join us at Beam ‚Äì you will be setting up a commercial function and play the lead role in steering this. This is an opportunity to build a sales function alongside a great engineering team which is already receiving accolades from its customers. 


#### Improving the world of connected vehicles

The experience that users get with today's connected vehicle solutions is typically poor - painfully slow, clunky, and often insecure. We believe that part of the reason for this is the way those solutions are delivered - outsourced to numerous companies, none of which have a deep understanding, nor the responsibility for the end-to-end system. 

Delivering a robust connected vehicle solution requires a wide variety of skills and experience. At Beam, we are a truly multi-disciplinary team, covering all the skills required to deliver a first class connected experience. Our flagship product is the Connected Vehicle as a Service platform, or CVaaS. This platform includes: electronics hardware which is deployed in a vehicle, embedded software, cloud services and mobile applications. We underpin this with innovations in cyber security and improving system performance.

We do all this under one roof, providing our customers with a best-in-class system and a single point of accountability. 


#### Building a commercial team to support our  world class development team

We have launched the Connected Vehicle as a Service (CVaaS) platform and deployed it to several lead customers.

We are now building a commercial function within Beam Connectivity to accelerate the roll out of this platform. Our ambition is to win deployments into vehicle programmes providing our customers with a leading connected vehicle solution.
