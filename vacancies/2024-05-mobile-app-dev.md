### About Beam Connectivity

Beam Connectivity are a startup in the automotive IoT space. We work with established and up-and-coming vehicle manufacturers to deliver best-in-class connected vehicle experiences. After a successful first 4 years and [announcement of strategic funding](https://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/wae-announces-a-strategic-equity-investment-in-beam-connectivity-limited-supporting-the-commercialisation-of-connected-vehicle-systems/) from Fortescue WAE, we have now secured new projects and are expanding our software team. 

Join us at Beam - as an early team member you will play a key role in our growth, while we take a key role in yours.

#### Improving the world of connected vehicles

The experience that users get with today's connected vehicle solutions is pretty poor - painfully slow, clunky and often insecure. We believe that part of the reason for this is the way those solutions are delivered - outsourced to numerous companies, none of which have a deep understanding, nor the responsibility for the end-to-end system. 

Delivering a robust automotive IoT solution requires a wide variety of skills and experience. At Beam, we are a truly multi-disciplinary team, covering all the skills required to deliver a first class connected experience. Our flagship product is the _Connected Vehicle as a Service platform_, or CVaaS. This platform includes: 1) Electronics hardware deployed in a vehicle, 2) Embedded software, 3) Cloud services, 4) Mobile apps. We do all this under one roof, so you'll be exposed to all this technology at one time or other. This should excite you, not scare you... 

At Beam, we spend our engineering energy on three main things: 
* Building out our core CVaaS platform - Building new features, adding resilience, and rolling this out to vehicle manufacturers.
* Research projects to help our long term CVaaS platform roadmap - Examples: [AutoCHERI](https://autocheri.tech), satellite comms PoC, video streaming (car-to-mobile) and novel data compression.
* Building the [Elysia platform](https://elysia.co/) with our investor, Fortescue WAE.

#### Thoughtful technology choices

We use modern software delivery practices to build clean, resilient software. We invest in the automation of manual tasks, heavily leveraging CI-CD, test automation and feature flags in production. As we are a small team we need to make sustainable technology choices for the long term, understanding and articulating the risks and trade-offs of our design decisions within the team. 

### The Role

We are looking for someone who is confident building out mobile apps on Android and iOS. We use native code for our apps - Kotlin and Swift - and we have a small mobile app team but are looking to grow it. We need someone to join the team who can lead on one of the platforms, but contribute where required on the other. 

Our CVaaS platform is used by vehicle manufacturers to provide connectivity either for internal business use cases, or to allow their customers to manage their ownership experience. We maintain an SDK for each mobile platform (iOS/Android) and build a bespoke mobile app for each of our customers, so it can be branded appropriately and published under our client's brand name.  

We are looking for someone who isn't intimidated by working in a startup environment, where we put trust and responsibility on every team member. We do have strong processes in place for the design and delivery of software, so are looking for someone who can fit in with our engineering culture and suggest improvements along the way. 

During your time at Beam you will be working on both mobile OS platforms for our core CVaaS product, but also have the opportunity to run small research projects/PoCs so that we can push the boundaries of what a connected vehicle system can do.

#### Main responsibilities

No two days are the same, but we would look for you to own delivery of the following functions, with the support of our wider team.

1. Develop and maintain our mobile SDKs for integration with our CVaaS cloud (REST APIs + MQTT).
1. Develop bespoke mobile apps for our mobility customers - typically car and motorbike manufacturers.
1. Design and deliver our in-house demo apps for our CVaaS platform - we want beautiful demostrations of what we can do.
1. Work as part of the team to integrate and debug the end-to-end connected system: Hardware, cloud and mobile apps.

#### Core skills

These are the primary skills that the job entails.

1. Great with either Swift or Kotlin, and capable with the other one.
1. Using Figma (or similar) to understand a design and faithfully implement it.
1. Be a good communicator - working remotely requires that we are comfortable articulating really complex things.
1. Being a nice person - we are a distributed team, so building and maintaining relationships within the team is key!

#### Nice to have skills

These are disciplines that we are already strong in because they're part of our core stack. Any experience you have with these would be a bonus, but is by no means a requirement.

1. Hands-on Kotlin multi-platform experience.
1. Unit and UI test frameworks for Swift and Kotlin.
1. Designing beatiful looking mobile apps in Figma or similar design tools.
1. Experience with Blutooth/BLE communications with IoT devices.
1. Android Auto or Carplay skills.
