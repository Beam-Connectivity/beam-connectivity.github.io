# Connected Vehicle as a Service - Privacy Statement

CVaaS is a B2B connected vehicle platform, used by vehicle manufacturers.

We take our obligations as a Data Processor under GDPR seriously, but if you would like to talk to us generally about data privacy, please email [privacy@beamconnectivity.com](mailto://privacy@beamconnectivity.com).


### Mobile Apps - iOS and Android

At Beam we use Google Play and Apple TestFlight to privately distribute and test our mobile apps. 

Permissions requested on the device:

* 📍 Location

We collect the following data:

* 🔒 Location data - To provide maps and calculate your nearest EV charging location
* 🔒 Device data such as device id, handset and OS version - To understand user experience and app performance to improve the app.
* 🔒 Crash data - To diagnose user issues and improve the app.


### Third party Data Processors

The CVaaS platform is built on AWS, but we do leverage some other third party services that will process your data.

* ☁️ Amazon Web Services - providing user authentication services and hosting for the CVaaS cloud databases
* ☁️ Google Firebase - Crash reports and app telemetry
* ☁️ Stripe - Payments for EV charging

If you would like us to close your account and delete your user data, please email [privacy@beamconnectivity.com](mailto://privacy@beamconnectivity.com)


### Cloud Platform

To maximise data privacy of our CVaaS cloud platform, we commit to:

* 🔒 Deploy an isolated cloud platform per customer.
* 🔒 Deploy in an EU region, unless specifically requested we use Dublin (EU-WEST-1).
* 🔒 Only collect data as identified by our CVaaS customer use cases - this collection is controlled through granular policy on a per vehicle basis.
* 🔒 Follow industry best practices for data collection and storage, such as encryption at rest and audited, least privilege access.
* 🔒 Conduct AWS Well Architected reviews to ensure we consider all aspects of security and privacy.
* 🔒 Work with customers to perform a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) in line with your own corporate processes.
* 🔒 Welcome scrutiny from customer privacy and security teams.
