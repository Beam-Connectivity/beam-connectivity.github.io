          <p>Hello 👋🏼</p>

<p>Want to know what we’re building? Our main platform is called CVaaS - Connected Vehicle as a Service - and it’s made up of hardware and software that runs on a vehicle, a cloud platform on AWS, and some mobile apps.</p>

<p>We supply the complete, end-to-end platform so we can optimse the performance and security of the whole system rather than being locked into an API that we can’t change. If you want to understand more about our platform, check out our main website at <a href="https://beamconnectivity.com">https://beamconnectivity.com</a>.</p>

<p>This site is all about our Beam Team developers - our high performance, cross-functional team of embedded, cloud and mobile engineers.</p>

<h1 id="why-work-at-beam">Why work at Beam?</h1>

<p>Founded in early 2020, we are sustainably growing the team. Working with us offers a host of benefits, including:</p>

<p>🚗 We work at the cutting edge of automotive &amp; mobility technology - Connected cars, EVs, eBikes, cyber security</p>

<p>👩🏼‍💻 We use modern tech and dev practices that improve our lives as developers</p>

<p>👨🏼‍🏫 We are digital by default and always looking to improve <em>how</em> we work</p>

<p>👐🏼 We love OSS, both using and contributing</p>

<p>🤼 The whole team is super-smart and friendly</p>

<p>📍 We are a remote and flexible team - fitting in with life commitments is important to us</p>

<p>🥳 We build great products and have fun doing it</p>

<h1 id="we--modern-tech">We ❤ modern tech</h1>

<p>We use the right tool for the job but do try to converge around a few, solid but flexible technologies.</p>

<p>🚗 <strong>Embedded</strong>: Linux, C, bash, python, SQLite</p>

<p>⛅ <strong>Cloud</strong>: MQTT, AWS serverless, Python, Javascript, Presto DB, Apache Spark, CloudFlare</p>

<p>📱 <strong>Mobile</strong>: Swift, Kotlin, Fastlane, Firebase</p>

<p>🧰 <strong>DevOps</strong>: Docker, Azure DevOps, bash, python</p>

<p>Our CI-CD infrastructure is highly automated and runs on Azure DevOps. We are rightfully proud of how smoothly and consistently we can deliver quality software. Our delivery process gives us clear traceability from tickets, through code, tests and PRs, and out to automated release pipelines.</p>

<p>We also do a lot of hardware engineering, both prototyping with Raspberry Pis and developing our own, bespoke, automotive-grade electronics.</p>

<h1 id="interview-process-">Interview process <a name="interview-process"></a></h1>

<p>As a small company, every hire is important to our growth. We are remote-first using modern, digital tools, so the ability to communicate clearly is an essential skill that we all need. As an engineer we need you to be able to articulate problems you’re having, explain how things work, and influence other members of the Beam Team when you have a killer idea. We believe that interviews are a two-way process - it is vital we understand what we each are looking for.</p>

<p>We recruit for potential and to maximise fit with the team, rather than demanding the right buzzwords on your CV. We don’t expect you to have exercised all the skills we need (<em>else how does anyone get a break?</em>) but a successful candidate should be able to convince us that they can do the job. This is the interview process:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Background reading</strong> - We will review your CV and any other information you provide such as your github account, LinkedIn profile and any community projects you’ve worked on in the public domain. We ask that you review our <a href="https://beamconnectivity.com">website</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/we_are_beam">twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/beam-connectivity">LinkedIn</a> pages. The idea here is that we should each get an idea of each other’s background.</li>
  <li><strong>Initial meeting</strong> - This is an opportunity for you to understand who Beam Connectivity are and for us to learn more about you. This stage is less about technical knowledge and more about where you’ve been and where you want to go. <em>30 minutes - 1 hour</em></li>
  <li><strong>Technical interview</strong> - Now that we know a bit about each other, we will work through some of the more technical aspects of the role. We will typically ask you to talk through a project that you’ve recently worked on and we might ask you to whiteboard out the inner workings and ask questions about how you debug issues - that kind of thing. We promise not to ask you any brain teasers or trick questions, and we won’t make you write code in front of us. <em>1 - 2 hours</em></li>
  <li><strong>Final interview</strong> - An opportunity to meet a couple of other people in Beam Connectivity, so you can ask questions and get to know more about what it’s like being part of the team. <em>30 minutes - 1 hour</em></li>
</ol>
